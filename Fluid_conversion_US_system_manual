/***************************************************************************************************
PROGRAM : Fluid_conversion_US.cpp
PURPOSE : It will convert the value of fluid ounce(s) into other US fluid quantities.
          For this reason, it will take the value of fluid ounce(s) as input,
          and will show the output allocating the input value into
          various units, like- barrels, gallons, quarts, cups, etc.

The program is created to convert the value of fluid ounces into other US fluid quantities, such as- barrel(s), gallon(s), quart(s), pint(s), cup(s), gill(s), and tablespoon(s). After running the program, the program will take the number of fluid ounces as the input, and will store it in a long type variable named fluid_ounce. After that, the program will calculate, convert this value into other quantities, and will store the value in other long type variables named table_spoon, gill, pint, cup, quart, pint, gallon, and barrel.
The program will use the following algorithm to convert the quantities perfectly.
table_spoon = (fluid_ounce % 4) * 2;
	gill = fluid_ounce / 4;
	cup = gill / 2;
	gill = gill % 2;
	pint = cup / 2;
	cup = cup % 2;
	quart = pint / 2;
	pint = pint % 2;
	gallon = quart / 4;
	quart = quart % 4;
	barrel = gallon / 42;
	gallon = gallon % 42;

After that, the program will show the user, his/her desired output i.e. fluid ounce(s), converted in other US quantities.

Note:- The program is made using the formatting directives in the iomanip library.
